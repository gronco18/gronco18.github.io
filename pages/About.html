            I am a student at Tufts University in Medford, MA studying Computer
            Science and Political Science. I am originally from CT, though I
            spend most of my time outside of school on my grandmother's farm in
            WV. As you can see from the menu items above, some of my hobbies
            include writing, photography, and software development.

            I am particularly interested in security, data and privacy
            policies. I'm also interested in woman's issues-- you could call
            me an unapologetic feminist. In the future I
            hope to use the skills I develop in college to help other women.
