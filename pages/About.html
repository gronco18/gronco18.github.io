        <div class = "description">
            I am a student at Tufts University in Medford, MA studying Computer
            Science and Political Science. I am originally from CT, though I
            spend most of my time outside of school on my grandmother's farm in
            WV. Some of my hobbies include writing, photography, running, 
            hiking and gardening.  
	    <div><div> <br>
            I am particularly interested in cyber security, data and privacy
            policies. In my interdisciplinary studies, I hope to learn more
	    about how people interact with technology and how technology impacts 
	    society. Further, as a political science major, I am interested in 
	    understanding digital strategies for both campaigns and companies.
