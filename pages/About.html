        <div class = "description">
            I am a student at Tufts University in Medford, MA studying Computer
            Science and Political Science. I am originally from CT, though I
            spend most of my time outside of school on my grandmother's farm in
            WV. Some of my hobbies include writing, photography, running, 
            hiking and gardening.  
            <div><div> <br>
            At Tufts, I am involved in a number of different political and techinical
	    organizations. I am the curriculum director on the executive board of 
	    Tufts CIVIC, a non-partisan political discussion group on campus. In this
	    position, I pick topics to discuss, do research, and then moderate discussion.
	    I am also a part of Jumbocode, a group that develops applications for non-profit
	    organizations. 
	    <div><div> <br>
            I am particularly interested in cyber security, data and privacy
            policies. In my interdisciplinary studies, I hope to learn more
	    about how people interact with technology and how technology impacts 
	    society. Further, as a political science major, I am interested in 
	    understanding digital strategies for both campaigns and companies.
